                offers mid-range and top-of-the-line fashion, skincare, jewellery and accessories.

                <p>Nighthawks have had a
                mall to call their own since the mall opened its doors and kept them open into the wee hours (the name is a combination
                of am and pm). This after-dark shopping hub houses over 170 retail outlets which close at midnight, while restaurants
                stay open until 2am and entertainment spots carry on until dawn.</p>
